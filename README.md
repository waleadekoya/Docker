# Flask-on-Docker
Package simple flask web application with Docker served by `uwsgi` web server

Requirements:

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/). The Community Edition (CE) will suffice.
2. `Docker for Mac` and `Docker for Windows` [link](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) already include Docker Compose.

Task Lists:

- [ ] Add a Relational database `MySQL`, `PostgreSQL`
- [ ] Demo with NoSQL database (i.e) `MongoDB`
- [ ] Use `Gunicorn` instead of `uwsgi`
- [ ] Create production prototype flask web application
